# Physics for Psychology

Psychologists and behavioral scientists in general should know some physics.
Not that behavioral scientists should have physics envy.
I think the reverse is true.
Physicists should envy, or better, sympathize with psychology.
Our field is so much harder.

This repository contains some materials related to what I think psychologists will benefit from knowing, or at least what I am glad I have learned along the way.

The topics stray a bit from physics *per se* so an alternative working title is "Background You May Wish You'd Had".
