# Statics and kinematics

## Forces

### Gravity

Most creatures on Earth live in an environment where the force of gravity, both in magnitude and direction, is constant.

- Center of mass
- Moment of inertia
    - Animals change shape and thereby shift their centers of mass and change the inertia tensor.

### Friction

Without friction, land animals would never move.

### Air/fluid pressure

- Locomotion via fluid media
    - Differs from boats -- biological entities don't have independently moving parts, topologically simple (no holes like jet engines)

### Lift/buoyancy
